## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    go build -o fabric ./cmd/fabric
    ```

3. Create necessary directories and set permissions:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p /Users/jmdb/.config/fabric/logs
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /Users/jmdb/.config/fabric
    chmod -R 755 /Users/jmdb/.config/fabric
    ```

4. Change ownership of the .env file:
    ```sh
    sudo chown $(whoami) /Users/jmdb/.config/fabric/.env
    ```

5. Run the setup command:
    ```sh
    ./fabric --setup
    ```

If there is no `fabric` executable or script in the repository, it is possible that the setup process is managed differently. Here are a few steps to determine the correct setup process:

1. **Check the README file**: Look for a `README.md` or similar documentation file in the repository. This file often contains instructions on how to set up and run the project.

2. **Check for a Makefile**: Look for a `Makefile` in the repository. If it exists, it might contain setup instructions. You can run the `make` command to see available targets:

    ```sh
    make
    ```

3. **Check for other setup scripts**: Look for other setup scripts such as `setup.sh`, `install.sh`, or similar files in the repository. These scripts might contain the necessary setup commands.

4. **Check for Go commands**: If the project is written in Go, there might be specific Go commands to set up the project. Look for a `main.go` file or other Go files in the repository. You might need to build the project using `go build` or run specific Go commands.

5. **Check for configuration files**: Look for configuration files such as `config.yaml`, `config.json`, or similar files that might contain setup instructions.

6. **Check for documentation**: Look for a `docs` directory or other documentation files in the repository that might contain setup instructions.

If you provide more details about the project structure or any specific files you see in the repository, I can give more targeted advice. Here is an example of how you might structure the setup process based on common files:

Check the README file for setup instructions.
