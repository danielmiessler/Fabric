### PR [#1739](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1739) by [2b3pro](https://github.com/2b3pro): Feature/structured outputs

- Chore(release): Update version to v..1
- Feat: Add --schema flag for structured AI outputs
Implement the `--schema` CLI flag to enable AI models to generate structured JSON output based on a provided JSON Schema.
This feature has been integrated with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models, allowing for predictable and parseable responses. New patterns for generating JSON schemas and extracting data according to a schema have also been added, alongside comprehensive documentation.
