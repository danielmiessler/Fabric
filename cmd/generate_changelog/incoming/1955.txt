### PR [#1955](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1955) by [copyleftdev](https://github.com/copyleftdev): feat: add md2toon Markdown to TOON transpiler

- Added md2toon Markdown to TOON transpiler that converts fabric Markdown prompts to TOON format for approximately 80% token savings when sending prompts to LLMs
- Implemented rule-based parser that extracts structure from Markdown prompts with TOON encoder per Spec v3.0 and tabular array compression
- Rewrote md2toon in Go to align with Fabric codebase and simplified to follow Unix philosophy with stdin→stdout by default and optional file output
- Achieved 234/234 test passes against full pattern corpus with 78.4% token savings after Go rewrite
- Updated to use strings.SplitSeq for Go 1.23+ compatibility
