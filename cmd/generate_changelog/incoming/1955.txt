### PR [#1955](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1955) by [copyleftdev](https://github.com/copyleftdev): feat: add md2toon Markdown to TOON transpiler

- Feat: add md2toon Markdown to TOON transpiler
Add a Python tool that converts fabric Markdown prompts to TOON format
(Token-Oriented Object Notation) for ~80% token savings when sending
prompts to LLMs.
Features:
- Rule-based parser extracts structure from Markdown prompts

- TOON encoder per Spec v3.0 with tabular array compression
- Optional LLM-powered extraction (Anthropic/OpenAI)

- CLI with single file and batch conversion modes
- Benchmarking to show token savings
Tested against full pattern corpus: 233/233 success, 79.9% savings.
