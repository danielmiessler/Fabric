### PR [#2020](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2020) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): Add `wire` Debug Level for LLM Request/Response Logging

- Feat: add `wire` debug level (4) for full LLM request/response debug logging
- Add `Wire` log level constant to debug level enum and expose `GetLevel()` for safe concurrent level reads
- Log outbound message roles/content, inbound stream updates, token usage, and non-streaming LLM responses at wire debug level
- Update `--debug` flag description and `set_debug_level` locale strings across all 10 languages to include new level 4
- Update zsh, bash, and fish shell completions to include the new `4` (`wire`) debug level value
