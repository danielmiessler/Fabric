### PR [#2036](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2036) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): WebUI: YouTube URL Processing Refactor & Dependency Updates

- Feat: Inline YouTube transcripts into the chat flow, replacing YouTube URLs with fetched transcript blocks and supporting multiple links per message
- Feat: Always render the user message before processing the response, with a YouTube-specific loading indicator displayed during transcript fetch
- Fix: Reset YouTube URL state after submission processing to prevent stale data across messages
- Chore: Upgrade SvelteKit, Svelte, Tailwind, and TypeScript toolchain versions, along with bumped `pdfjs-dist` and `@napi-rs/canvas` optional dependency versions
- Chore: Regenerate `pnpm`/`npm` lockfiles to reflect updated transitive dependencies
