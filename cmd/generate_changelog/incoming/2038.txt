### PR [#2038](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/2038) by [ksylvan](https://github.com/ksylvan): Add Git CLI Fallback to `FetchFilesFromRepo`

- Feat: add git CLI fallback to `FetchFilesFromRepo` for improved compatibility
- Add git CLI fallback when go-git in-memory clone fails, with detection via `exec.LookPath`
- Implement `fetchFilesViaGitCLI` using a shallow `--depth 1` clone into a temp directory with deferred cleanup
- Respect `SingleDirectory` and `PathPrefix` options in the CLI path, and surface a combined error when both go-git and CLI fallback fail
- Extract `fetchFilesViaGoGit` into a dedicated helper function and add a `copyFile` helper to support CLI-based file extraction
