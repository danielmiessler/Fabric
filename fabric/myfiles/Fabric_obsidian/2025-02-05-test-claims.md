# ANALYSIS:

**ARGUMENT SUMMARY:** The argument posits that the observation of ships disappearing bottom-first over the horizon proves the Earth is flat.

**TRUTH CLAIMS:**

**CLAIM:** Ships disappear bottom first because the Earth is flat.
**CLAIM SUPPORT EVIDENCE:**
*   There is no scientific support for this claim.

**CLAIM REFUTATION EVIDENCE:**
*   **Curvature of the Earth:** The phenomenon of ships disappearing hull first over the horizon is a direct result of the Earth's curvature. As a ship sails away, it gradually goes out of sight because the curve of the Earth obstructs the view. ([Source: NOAA](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/earth-round.html))
*   **Observation from Higher Altitude:** If the Earth were flat, one could theoretically continue to see a ship with a telescope as it moves further away. However, in reality, raising the observer's altitude allows them to see the ship again, which had previously disappeared hull first. This demonstrates the curvature.

**LOGICAL FALLACIES:**

*   **False Cause:** The argument incorrectly assumes that the way ships disappear is caused by the Earth being flat, when it is actually due to the Earth's curvature.
*   **Affirming the Consequent:** The argument assumes that because ships disappear bottom-first (the consequent), the Earth must be flat (the antecedent).

**CLAIM RATING:** F (Definitely False)

**LABELS:** Baseless, fallacious, pseudoscientific

**OVERALL SCORE:**

LOWEST CLAIM SCORE: F
HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: F
AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE: F

**OVERALL ANALYSIS:**
The argument is fundamentally flawed due to its reliance on a misinterpretation of observable phenomena. The disappearance of ships hull-first is evidence of the Earth's curvature, not its flatness. One should update their understanding by studying basic physics and observational astronomy.
