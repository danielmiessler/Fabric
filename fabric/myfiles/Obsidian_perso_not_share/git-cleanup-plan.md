# Git Repository Restoration Plan

## Chosen Approach: `git checkout origin/main`

### Why This Approach
1. Preserves Critical Files:
   - Keeps ENV files and local configurations
   - Maintains all .gitignore'd files
   - Preserves application functionality

2. Complete Repository Structure:
   - Updates entire working directory properly
   - Maintains git history
   - Ensures structural consistency

3. Safe for Local Customizations:
   - Respects .gitignore rules
   - Keeps local environment setup
   - Preserves custom configurations

### Steps to Execute

1. Ensure Remote is Configured
```bash
# Add remote if not present
git remote add origin https://github.com/jmd1010/FABRIC2.git
# Or update if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jmd1010/FABRIC2.git
```

2. Fetch Latest Changes
```bash
git fetch origin
```

3. Perform Checkout
```bash
git checkout origin/main
```

### Expected Results
- Working directory will match remote main branch
- All ENV files and configurations preserved
- Application remains functional
- Local customizations maintained
- Repository structure properly updated

### Verification Steps
1. Confirm ENV files are intact
2. Verify application can still run
3. Check that latest changes are present
4. Test core functionality

This approach provides the best balance of updating the repository while maintaining necessary local configurations and ensuring the application remains functional.
