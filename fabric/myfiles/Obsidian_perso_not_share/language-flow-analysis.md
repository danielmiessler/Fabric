# Language Flow Analysis

## News Article Flow (Working)
1. Input: "Here's a news article --fr"
2. Language Detection:
   - Detects --fr
   - Sets languageStore to 'fr'
   - Removes --fr flag
3. Pattern Execution:
   - Article text goes directly to ChatService
   - ChatService adds language instruction
   - Pattern executes with language flag
4. Reset:
   - Language resets to 'en' after response

## YouTube Flow (Current)
1. Input: "https://youtube.com/... --fr"
2. Language Detection:
   - Detects --fr
   - Sets languageStore to 'fr'
   - Removes --fr flag
3. Transcript:
   - Gets raw transcript first
   - Then sends to ChatService
   - ChatService adds language instruction
   - Pattern executes with language flag
4. Reset:
   - Language resets to 'en' after response

## Key Insight
The transcript should be treated exactly like a news article - it's just text that needs to be processed by the pattern with a language flag. The fact that it comes from YouTube doesn't change how the language flag should be handled.

## Solution Direction
1. Keep the language flag handling identical for both cases
2. Let the pattern execution handle the language for both:
   - News articles: text + language flag
   - YouTube: transcript + language flag
3. Reset language only after pattern execution completes

This way, whether the text comes from direct input or a YouTube transcript, the pattern execution sees the same thing: text content plus a language flag.
