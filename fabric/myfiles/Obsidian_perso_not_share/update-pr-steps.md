# Steps to Update Existing Pull Request with New Enhancements

## 1. Update Your FabricDM Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your FabricDM directory
cd /path/to/FabricDM

# Make sure you're on your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-improvements

# Pull any updates from upstream if needed
git remote add upstream https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

## 2. Copy New Changes
Copy the following modified/new files from your Fabric2 repository to FabricDM:

### Pattern Search Feature:
- `fabric/web/src/lib/components/patterns/PatternList.svelte`
- `fabric/web/src/lib/components/ui/input/Input.svelte`

### Obsidian Integration:
- Any modified files related to Obsidian integration

## 3. Update Documentation
- Copy the enhanced PR description from `enhanced-pattern-selection-update.md` to document the new features

## 4. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add pattern search and Obsidian integration enhancements

- Added search functionality to pattern selection modal
- Added Obsidian integration for pattern execution output
- Updated documentation"

# Push to your feature branch
git push origin feature/your-improvements
```

## 5. Update Pull Request
The push will automatically update your existing pull request. You should:
1. Update the PR description with the new content from enhanced-pattern-selection-update.md
2. Add a comment mentioning the new enhancements you've added
3. Request a new review

## Benefits of This Approach
1. Keeps all related improvements in one PR
2. Maintains the context of your changes
3. Makes it easier for reviewers to understand the full scope
4. Avoids fragmenting the review process

## Note
Make sure to test all functionality after copying files to ensure everything works correctly in the FabricDM repository.
