# Fabric Helpers

These are helper tools to work with Fabric. Examples include things like getting transcripts from media files, getting metadata about media, etc.

## yt (YouTube)

`yt` is a command that uses the YouTube API to pull transcripts, get video duration, and other functions. It's primary function is to get a transcript from a video that can then be stitched (piped) into other Fabric Patterns.
