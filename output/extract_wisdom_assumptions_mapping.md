## SUMMARY

David Bland teaches Assumptions Mapping, a systematic framework for identifying, prioritizing, and testing business idea hypotheses across desirability, viability, and feasibility dimensions to reduce startup failure risk.

---

## IDEAS

- 90% of startups fail and 42% fail specifically because they build products that nobody actually wants.
- 7 out of 10 new products fail to deliver on expectations despite significant investment in development.
- Assumptions Mapping makes desirability, viability, and feasibility hypotheses explicit and prioritizes them systematically for testing.
- Teams often get excited about experimentation but conduct tests without targeting their riskiest assumptions first.
- The Build-Measure-Learn cycle traps teams into building just to build instead of building to learn.
- Starting with "What do you want to learn?" reframes experimentation from mechanical execution to strategic discovery.
- Flawed assumptions are one of the worst barriers to innovation because they create self-imposed limits.
- The human mind treats its own assumptions as facts rather than testable hypotheses requiring validation.
- Desirability asks "Do they want it?" focusing on customer problems and market demand for solutions.
- Viability asks "Should we do it?" focusing on sustainable business model and revenue generation potential.
- Feasibility asks "Can we do it?" focusing on technical capability and resource availability for delivery.
- Adaptability asks whether the idea can survive and evolve in changing market conditions over time.
- Using "We believe that..." format mentally shifts teams from certainty to testing mindset immediately.
- The 2x2 prioritization matrix plots assumptions by importance on Y-axis and evidence on X-axis.
- The top-right quadrant contains beliefs critical for success that have the least supporting evidence.
- Evidence should be observable data whether qualitative or quantitative rather than organizational hierarchy opinions.
- Strong evidence comes from actual customer behavior like purchases and usage patterns not stated intentions.
- Moderate evidence comes from stated intentions while weak evidence comes from opinions alone about ideas.
- Teams should hold their opinions loosely while remaining confident enough to take action on hypotheses.
- Mapping assumptions together reveals where cross-functional teams should focus their experimentation efforts collaboratively.
- Discovery experiments test initial ideas while validation experiments confirm the chosen path was correct.
- The book contains 44 different experiment types organized by cost, time, and strength of evidence.
- Customer interviews take 1-2 days setup and 30 minutes per interview providing strong qualitative insights.
- Minimum Viable Products take 2-8 weeks setup and 4-12 weeks runtime providing very strong behavioral evidence.
- Dropbox validated demand with an explainer video before building any actual product proving market need.
- Zappos validated online shoe sales by manually purchasing items before building their e-commerce platform infrastructure.
- Airbnb tested peer-to-peer accommodation willingness using air mattresses during a design conference event.
- Teams underestimate time required to run multiple high-quality experiments and should dedicate weekly testing time.
- Analysis paralysis happens when teams cannot move forward because they obsess over choosing the right action.
- Testing problems before solutions validates customer pain points exist before investing in building solutions.
- Each test reveals new assumptions to validate creating an iterative learning cycle through experimentation.

## INSIGHTS

- Most startups fail not from execution problems but from building solutions to problems customers do not have.
- Assumptions become invisible constraints when teams treat beliefs as facts rather than testable hypotheses requiring evidence.
- The experimentation mindset shift from building to learning fundamentally changes what teams prioritize and measure.
- Prioritizing high-impact low-evidence assumptions focuses limited resources on tests that actually matter strategically.
- Behavioral evidence from customer actions vastly outweighs stated preferences for validating business model assumptions.
- Cross-functional assumption mapping creates shared understanding that prevents siloed teams from validating wrong hypotheses.
- The four-dimension framework ensures teams do not over-index on technical feasibility while ignoring market desirability.
- Systematic validation through small experiments produces insights that large development investments cannot replicate cheaply.
- Real-world examples like Dropbox and Zappos prove that minimal tests can validate billion-dollar business ideas.
- Evidence hierarchy awareness prevents teams from confusing customer opinions with actual purchase intent signals.

## HABITS

- Ask "What do you want to learn?" before designing any experiment to ensure strategic focus on outcomes.
- Write assumptions using "We believe that..." format to maintain testable hypothesis mindset throughout process.
- Use one statement per sticky note avoiding bullet points to maintain clarity and specificity.
- Ground all mapped assumptions in current knowledge rather than speculation or wishful thinking patterns.
- Hold opinions loosely while maintaining confidence to act on the best available evidence today.
- Color-code sticky notes by dimension type distinguishing desirability, viability, and feasibility assumptions visually.
- Set aside dedicated weekly time for testing, discovering, and adapting rather than ad-hoc experimentation.
- Start with desirability hypotheses first then move through feasibility, viability, and adaptability assumptions systematically.
- Focus experimentation on the top-right quadrant containing important assumptions with least supporting evidence.
- Distinguish between strong behavioral evidence, moderate stated intentions, and weak opinion-based feedback consistently.
- Run discovery experiments before validation experiments to test initial ideas before confirming chosen paths.
- Define clear success metrics before running any experiment to avoid post-hoc rationalization of results.
- Document learnings from each experiment to create institutional knowledge and prevent repeated mistakes.
- Iterate on learning recognizing each test reveals new assumptions requiring subsequent validation cycles.
- Present investment decisions with customer research and pilot data rather than projections and assumptions.
