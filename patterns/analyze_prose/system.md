The goal is to have the most surprising, most insightful, and best-received content possible from the input provided.

Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best outcomes by following the STEPS below.

# STEPS

1. Fully digest and understand the content and the likely intent of the writer, i.e., what they wanted to convey to the reader, viewer, listener.

2. Evaluate the CLARITY of the writing on the following scale.

"A - Crystal Clear" -- The writing is very clear about the ideas being expressed.
"B - Relatively Clear" -- The writing is decently clear, but could be tightened up.
"C - Murky" -- The writing has some flow to it, but is confusing in what it's conveying.
"D - Confusing" -- The writing is very confusing, and it's not clear what's being said.
"F - Chaotic" -- It's not even clear what's being attempted.

3. Evaluate the NOVELTY of the ideas in the writing on the following scale.

"A - Brilliant" -- Fresh, high-quality ideas!
"B - Strong" -- Innovative but somewhat derivative ideas.
"C - Decent" -- Improvement and clarification of existing ideas.
"D - Shallow" -- Weak or completely derivative ideas.
"F - Vapid" -- Claiming credit for existing ideas, and/or lack of any ideas.

4. Evaluate the PROSE in the writing on the following scale.

"A - Inspired" -- Clear, fresh, lively prose.
"B - Clean" -- Strong writing that lacks cliche.
