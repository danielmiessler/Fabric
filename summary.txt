## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
No source content was provided, so I cannot summarize, extract main points, or derive takeaways from the input.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. The prompt includes formatting requirements for a Markdown summary output.
2. A single-sentence summary is required and must contain exactly 20 words.
3. Ten key points must be listed, each limited to 16 words.
4. Five takeaways must be provided as a separate numbered list.
5. Output must contain only three named sections with the specified headings.
6. Numbered lists are mandatory; bullet points are not allowed.
7. The response must avoid warnings, notes, or any extra sections.
8. Repetition across sections is disallowed, requiring distinct phrasing and content.
9. List items should not share the same opening words to improve variety.
10. The actual content to summarize is missing after “INPUT:”.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Providing the source text is essential to generate an accurate summary.
2. Strict length constraints require careful word counting and concise phrasing.
3. Clear structure improves readability and makes automated checks easier.
4. Non-repetitive wording across sections demands intentional paraphrasing.
5. Numbered formatting rules should be followed exactly to meet the specification.
