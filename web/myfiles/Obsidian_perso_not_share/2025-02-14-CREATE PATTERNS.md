ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: This video explains how to create and use custom patterns within the Fabric AI project by storing them locally.

MAIN POINTS:
1. Fabric patterns are prompts for solving problems using the Fabric AI project.
2. Existing Fabric patterns can be used directly from the command line.
3. Custom patterns are stored locally, not in the main Fabric repository.
4. The local directory for Fabric patterns is `config/Fabric/patterns`.
5. Create a custom directory and copy patterns into the Fabric patterns directory.
6. An alias can automate copying custom patterns to the correct directory.
7. Custom patterns are used by calling Fabric with the pattern name.
8. Local patterns are not shared unless submitted to the Fabric project.
9. Custom patterns can be used for personal, business, or journal review tasks.
10. AI processes the data, so it is not completely private, even with local patterns.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Custom patterns extend Fabric's functionality for specific use cases.
2. Local storage of patterns allows for private and personalized AI interactions.
3. Automating pattern deployment simplifies the creation process.
4. Understanding the file structure is key to managing custom patterns.
5. Fabric's flexibility supports both shared and private AI pattern usage.
