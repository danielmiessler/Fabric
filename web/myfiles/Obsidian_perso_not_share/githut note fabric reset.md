## Repository Structure
- Fork: jmd1010/fabric-contrib
- Original: danielmiessler/fabric
- Branch: feature/web-ui-enhancements

## Remote Configuration
- origin: git@github.com:jmd1010/fabricDM.git
- upstream: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric.git

## Development Environment
### Shell Configurations
- Updated .zshrc and .bashrc
- Corrected paths for new repository structure
- Go environment variables
- Pattern directory mappings

### Web Development Setup
- Backend: fabric --serve
- Frontend: npm run dev in web directory
- Development URLs and ports

## Pull Request Workflow
1. Sync with upstream
2. Feature branch development
3. Code review preparation
4. PR submission guidelines

## Backup Management
### Repository Setup
- Backup: git@github.com:jmd1010/fabric-backup.git
- Contains complete development environment
- Excludes only sensitive files (.env)
- Private repository for safety

### Backup Workflow
1. Regular backup pushes:
```bash
git push backup feature/web-ui-enhancements

2. After significant changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Development checkpoint - [description]"
git push backup feature/web-ui-enhancements

3. Before major refactoring:

git tag backup-pre-refactor-[date]
git push backup --tags


Development vs Backup

Backup repo: Complete environment preservation

Feature branch: Clean commits for PR

Separate commit messages for backup vs PR

Tag significant development points

Regular synchronization with both repos

Recovery Procedures

1. From backup:

git clone git@github.com:jmd1010/fabric-backup.git
git checkout feature/web-ui-enhancements

2. Environment restoration:

Copy .env.example to .env
Configure local paths
Install dependencies
Verify development setup


This structure provides:

1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Detailed workflow procedures
3. Recovery instructions
4. Best practices for both backup and development
5. Easy reference for ongoing work


Current Position - Remote Configuration
You're at the remote configuration step, which sets up the foundation for both development and backup workflows. Here's how it connects to the broader strategy:
Development Track
The remotes we're configuring:
git remote add upstream git@github.com:danielmiessler/fabric.git

Copy

Execute

terminal
git remote add origin git@github.com:jmd1010/fabricDM.git

Copy

Execute

terminal
These commands establish:
1. Direct link to upstream for pulling latest changes
2. Connection to your fork for PR preparation
Backup Track
Your backup workflow documentation adds an additional remote:
git remote add backup git@github.com:jmd1010/fabric-backup.git

Copy

Execute

terminal
This creates a three-remote structure:
* upstream - Source of truth (danielmiessler/fabric)
* origin - Your public fork for PRs
* backup - Your private backup repository
Integration with Pull Request Workflow
The remote setup enables:
1. Clean feature branch development (git checkout -b feature/web-ui-enhancements)
2. Regular syncs with upstream (git fetch upstream)
3. Isolated commits for PR (origin)
4. Full environment preservation (backup)
Backup Strategy Integration
Your backup workflow documentation enhances this by:
1. Providing checkpoints via tags
2. Maintaining complete development history
3. Preserving the full environment state
4. Enabling safe experimentation
The steps are consistent and complementary, creating a robust development environment with multiple safety nets while maintaining clean PR preparation paths.
